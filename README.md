Voice to Text

A Flutter application with Firebase email/password authentication and voice-to-text functionality using the `speech_to_text` package.

## Features

- Firebase email/password authentication (login and registration)
- Voice-to-text transcription using device microphone
- Protected routes with authentication state management
- Bottom navigation with Home, Voice, and Profile tabs
- Clean, minimal Material Design UI

## Prerequisites

- Flutter SDK (latest stable version)
- Dart SDK (3.9.2 or higher)
- Firebase account
- Android Studio / Xcode (for platform-specific builds)

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone and Install Dependencies

```bash
flutter pub get
```

### 2. Firebase Configuration

#### Install FlutterFire CLI

```bash
dart pub global activate flutterfire_cli
```

#### Login to Firebase

```bash
firebase login
```

#### Configure Firebase for Flutter

```bash
flutterfire configure
```

This command will:
- Generate `lib/firebase_options.dart` file
- Configure Firebase for Android, iOS, and Web platforms
- Set up the necessary platform-specific configurations

**Note:** Make sure you have a Firebase project created in the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/) before running this command.

### 3. Enable Email/Password Authentication in Firebase Console

1. Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
2. Select your project
3. Navigate to **Authentication** > **Sign-in method**
4. Enable **Email/Password** provider
5. Click **Save**

### 4. Platform-Specific Configuration

#### Android

The app requires the following permissions (already configured in `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`):
- `RECORD_AUDIO` - for microphone access
- `INTERNET` - for network connectivity

Ensure `minSdkVersion` is set to 21 or higher in `android/app/build.gradle.kts`.

#### iOS

The app requires the following permissions (already configured in `ios/Runner/Info.plist`):
- `NSSpeechRecognitionUsageDescription` - for speech recognition
- `NSMicrophoneUsageDescription` - for microphone access

## Running the App

### Android

```bash
flutter run
```

Or specify a device:

```bash
flutter run -d <device-id>
```

### iOS

```bash
flutter run
```

**Note:** For iOS, you may need to open the project in Xcode and configure signing certificates.

### Web

```bash
flutter run -d chrome
```

## Testing Voice Features

**Important:** Voice-to-text features should be tested on **real devices** rather than emulators/simulators, as:

- Emulators may not have proper microphone access
- Speech recognition requires actual audio input
- Permissions behave differently on real devices

### Testing Checklist

1. Test on a real Android device or iOS device
2. Grant microphone permissions when prompted
3. Test speech recognition in a quiet environment
4. Verify that transcripts appear in real-time
5. Test stopping and starting listening multiple times

```

## Dependencies

- `firebase_core` - Firebase core functionality
- `firebase_auth` - Firebase authentication
- `speech_to_text` - Speech recognition package

## Troubleshooting

### Firebase Not Initialized

If you see errors about Firebase not being initialized:
1. Ensure `flutterfire configure` has been run
2. Check that `lib/firebase_options.dart` exists
3. Verify Firebase project is properly configured

### Speech Recognition Not Working

1. Check that microphone permissions are granted
2. Test on a real device (not emulator)
3. Ensure you're in a quiet environment
4. Check device logs for permission errors

### Authentication Errors

1. Verify Email/Password is enabled in Firebase Console
2. Check that email format is valid
3. Ensure password meets minimum requirements (6+ characters)
4. Check Firebase Console for authentication logs
